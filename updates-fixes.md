# Pindeck Development Summary & To-Do List

## Goals Overview
- **Refine Image Generation Logic:** Adjust how the logic works so that users can choose how many variations they want and what kind of modifications they’d like.

- **Add User Prompts Before Upload:** Include a prompt that asks users if they want more images or variations before they upload an image.

- **Implement a 'Generate' Button:** Add a button on each image that brings up options for generating more content—like a storyboard or a deck—from the current image.

- **Fix Bookmark-to-Board Functionality:** Ensure that when users bookmark an image, it properly adds that image to a chosen board.

- **Enhance Board Features:** Allow boards to be more than just collections—make them convertible into storyboards or decks with easy templates.
